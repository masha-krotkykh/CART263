    <div>Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! <span class="redacted">I'm being repressed!</span> Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and <span class="redacted">social differences in our society.</span></div>
    <div>The Lady of the Lake, <span class="redacted">her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite</span> held aloft <span class="redacted">Excalibur</span> from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry <span class="redacted">Excalibur.</span> THAT is why I am your king.</div>
    <div>You don't frighten us, English pig dogs. Go and <span class="redacted">boil your bottoms,</span> you sons of a silly person.</div>
    <div>Are you suggesting <span class="redacted">coconuts migrate?</span></div>
